# Software Developer

<p> Hi there I'm Omer. I graduated from Aksaray University, Department of Management Information Systems.I am developing myself in the fields of back-end and coding.I am open to learning and follow new technologies closely.I am currently actively learning C#, ASP.Net, MVC, .NET Core. I developed applications according to my ideas.Even though I have added a lot to myself since the first time I started the software, I am also aware that there is a lot that I do not know.I'm trying to learn what I don't know by researching.Applying what I have learned is my biggest passion right now. :blush:</p>

<h3>Programmers constantly overcomplicate things because they think about the future. Forget about the future. Focus on the present.</h3> 
<h3>It is better to expect a productive programmer to be employable than to expect the first programmer found to be productive.</h3> 
<h3>The software does what you tell it to do, not what you want it to do.</h3>
<h3>Solve the matter first. Then write the code.</h3>
